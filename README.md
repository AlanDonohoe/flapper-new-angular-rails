This from the tutorial - https://thinkster.io/angular-rails

It is not a fully Rails API only app on the back end
and doesn't separate Angular out from the Rails backend.

It's more like a regular Rails app, that uses front end tooling:
Bower, etc, to manage an Angular front end.

For a completely separate Rails API app with Angular front end, see:
